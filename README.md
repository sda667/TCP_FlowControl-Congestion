# TCP Flow Control and Congestion

This project analyzes how **TCP flow control and congestion control** work using Wireshark captures.

It demonstrates:
- Receiver-limited throughput (flow control)
- Congestion avoidance with slow start, AIMD, retransmissions
- Comparison with ARQ protocols (Go-Back-N, Selective Repeat)

## Project Structure
- `TCP_Flow_Control_and_Congestion.pdf` → Full detailed lab report (with figures and equations)
- `TCP_Flow_Control_and_Congestion.md` → Markdown version of the report 

## Tools
- Wireshark
- TCP throughput analysis

## Key Results
- Flow control limits speed based on receiver capacity.
- Congestion control adapts dynamically to network conditions.
- TCP integrates reliability, retransmission, and congestion management.
